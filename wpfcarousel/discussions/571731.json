The Source Code version Works and is amazing. I used the Fluid Kit version of the Carousel for some time and because it wasn't interactive, I had to get the fluid kit carousel plus version from somewhere and it worked, but performed badly. It was also a nightmare to code to. This version however. Is performing amazing and it's much simpler though it might have fewer uses... <br />\n",
